## TECH

ZENDER uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Delightful JavaScript tester.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) - high level programming language used for Web
- [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) - Cross-origin resource sharing
